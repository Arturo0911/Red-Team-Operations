# SQLMAP Essentials




Most common kind of ways to make a possible sql injection


Boolean => AND 1=1-- -


Error => When a server return the problem of the query
        when it's executed witha miss query and the server
        return the name of the error, making possible search
        the database engine currently used and how to abuse it
        to take control for the queries.

        => AND GTID_SUBSET(@version,0)


Union Select => UNION ALL SELECT 1,@@version,3
With the usage of UNION, it is generally possible to extend the original
(vulnerable) query with injectted statements0 esults, This way, if the
original query results are rendered as part of the response, the attacker
can get additional results from the injected statements within the page 
response itself. This type of SQL injection is considered the fastest, as,
in the ideal scenarion, the attacker would be able to pull the content of
the whole database table of intereste with a single request.




Stack Queries => Stacking SQL queries, also known as the "piggy-backing", is
the form of injecting additional SQL statements after the vulnerable one. In 
case that there is a requirement for running non-query stateents (INSERT, UPDATE
OR DELETE), stacking myst be supported by the vulnerable platform(Microsoft SQL 
server and PostgreSQL) support it by default). SQLMAP can be use such vulnerabilities
to run non-query statements executed in advanced features(execution of OS commands) and
data retrieval similarly to time-based blind SQLi types.


Time-base blind SQL injections

AND 1=IF(2>1, SLEEP(5), 0)

The principle of Time-base blind SQL injection is similar to the boolean-based
blind sql injection, bu here the response time is used as the source for the
differentiation between TRUE or FALSE.

True response is generally characterized by the noticeable difference in the 
response time compared to the regular server response.

False response should result in a response time indistinguishable from regular
respose times

This is slower than Boolean-based
