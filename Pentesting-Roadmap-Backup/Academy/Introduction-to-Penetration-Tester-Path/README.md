# Introduction to the junior Penetration Tester Path

This module is an introduction to the Junior Penetration Tester Job Role Path and a 
general introduction to Pentration Tests and each of the phases that we cover in depth
throughout the modules. We recommend starting the path with this module and
referring to it periodically as you caomplete other modules to see how each topic area
fits in the bigger picture of the penetration testing process. This module is also a great
starting point for anyone new to HTB academy or the industry.

This path is intended for aspiting penetration testers from all walks of life and
experienced pentesters looking to upskill in a particular area, become more well-rounded
or learn things from a different perspective. This path covers core concepts neccessary
to succeed at External Penetration tests. Internal Penetration Tests (Both network and 
Active Directory), and Web application Security Assessments. Through each module, we dive 
deep into the specialized techniques, methodologies, and tools needed to success in a 
penetration testing role. The path takes students on a highly hands-on journey through 
all stages of a penetration test, from reconnaissance and enumeration to documentation
and reporting, culminatin with a simulated penetration test capstone module. Students
who complete this path in its entirely will be armed with the practical skills and mindset
necessary to perform professional security assessments against real-world networks at a
basic to intermediate level. Each of our modules dives deep into the "why" behind the 
issues and tacticas that we presend and is not just a tutorila on running point-and-click
tools. We weave in stories and scenarios from our real-world experience performing 
security assessments for clients in all verticals and local and federal government.


## HTB Academy Learning Philosophy

Our goal is to teach students how to see both sides of an issue and be able to find
flaws that others may miss. We encourage each student to formulate their own repeatable
and through methodology that can be applied to any assessment type, no matter the size of 
the environment or the client's industry. Learning in this way and working throught metho-
dology that can be applied to any assessment type, no matter the size of the environment or
the clien'ts industry. Learning in this way and working through hundreds of practical, hands
-on examples, with each module culminatin in one or more skills asessments, reinforces these
concepts and builds "muscle memory" around the things we preform on every assessment. If we
can perform the basics well, we have more time to dig deeper and provide extra value to our
clients. For every vulnerability and misconfiguration we demostrate, we discuss the underlying
flaw, which helps us netter undestand how things work, why a particular tool may be failing,
and provide more accurate remediation advice to our clients that can be tailored to their 
environment and risk appetite. 

Our learning philosophy can be summed up as the following:

  ```
  Our philosophy is "learn by doing," following a risk-based approach with a heavy
  emphaiss on hands-on learning and legal & ethical use of our skills. We strive to
  teach our students the "why" behind a vulnerability and how to discover, exploit,
  remediate, detect, and prevent the flaw to create well-rounded professionals who
  can pass this all-encompassing knowledge & mindset on to their current/future clients
  or employers to assist them in securing their people, technologies and missions from 
  modern cyber threats
  ```
