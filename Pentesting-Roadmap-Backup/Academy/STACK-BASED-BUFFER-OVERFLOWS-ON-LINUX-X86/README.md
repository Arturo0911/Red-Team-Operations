# STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWS ON LINUX X86



## The basic understanding about the primary and secondary memory

The pimary memory is the cache and the RAM. If we think about it 
logically, memory is nothing more than a place to store information. We can think of it
as leaving something at one of our firends to pick it up again later. But for this, it is
necessart to know the friend's address to pick up what we have left behind. It is the
same as RAM. RAM describes a memory type whose memory allocations can be
accessed directly and randomly by their memory addresses.

### Here comes the most important thing.
The cache is integrated into the processor and serves as a buffer, which in the best
case, ensures that the processor is always fed with data and program code. Before the
program code and data enter the proessor for processing, the RAM serves as data
storage. The size of the RAM determines the amount of data can be stored for the
processor. However, when the primary memory loss power, all stored contents are lost.
