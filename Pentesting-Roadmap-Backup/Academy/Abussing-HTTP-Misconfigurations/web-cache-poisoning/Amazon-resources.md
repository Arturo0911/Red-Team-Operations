The cache key determines whether a viewer request to a CloudFront edge location
results in a cache hit. The cache key is the unique identifier for an object in the cache.
Each object in the cache has a unique cache key.

A cache hit occurs when a viewer request generates the same cache key as a prior
request, and the object for that cache key is in the edge location's cache and valid.
When there's cache hit, the requested object is served to the  viewer from a 
CloudFront edge location, which has the following beffits:

    - Reduced load on your origin server
    - Reduced latency for the viewer


You can get better performance from your website or application when you have a 
higher cache hit ratio (a higher proportion fo viewer requsts that result in a cache hit).
One way to improve your cache hit ratio is to include only the minimum neccessary
values in the cache key. For more information, see the following sections.
