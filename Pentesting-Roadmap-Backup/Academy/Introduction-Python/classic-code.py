"""
In this section, we will talk about classes. And cake.
Let us start with the cake. When we have a piece of brownie
in front of us, let us, for the sake of argument, say this 
piece of brownie is an object of the food type Cake. Our piece
of cake has some properties that other pieces of cake might not 
have. One such property coud be the topiing wich in our case 
could be chocolate frosting and cherry. We need to ask ourselves
how this piece of cake was produced and what it consists of.
