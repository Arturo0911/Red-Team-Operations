# Introduction to Server-Side Attacks


    As mentioned in this module's summary, Server-Side Attacksl leverage the
    the below in a attempt to issue requests on behalf of the hosting applicaction
    server, leak sensitive data, or have the hosting applications server execute 
    attacker-supplied commands:

        - The trus between the final application intermediate
            machines/componenets or itself

        - User input-handling inefficienciesm such as differences
            regarding iterpretation or por validation



## Types of Server-Side Attacks

This module willcove different types of Server-Side attacks and how to exploit them.
These are:

    Abusing Intermediary Applications: Accessing internal applications not
        accessible from our network by leveraging specific 
        exposed binary protocols


    Server-Side Request Frogery (SSRF): Making the hosting application server issue
        requests to arbitrary external domains or internal resources in an attempt
        to identify sensitive data.
    
    Server-Side Includes Injection (SSI): Injecting a payload so that illintended 
        Server-Side Include directives are parsed to achieve remote code execution
        or leak sensitive data. This vulnerability occurs when poorly validated 
        user input manages to become part of a response that is parsed for Server-
        Side Include directives.

    Edfe-Side Includes Injection: Edge Side Includes (ESI) in an XML-based markup
        language used to tackle performance issuesby temporarily storing dynamic
