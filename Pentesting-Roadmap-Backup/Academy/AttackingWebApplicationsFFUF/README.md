#Fuzzing

The term fuzzing refers to a testing technique that sends various types of user input
to a certain interface to study how it would react. If we were fuzzing for SQL injection
vulnerabilities, we would be sending random special characters and seeing how the server
would react. If we were fuzzing for a buffer overflow, we woudl be sending long strngs
and incrementing heir lenght to see if and when te binary would break


We usually utilize pre-defined wordlists of commonly used temr for earh type of test
for web fuzzing to see if the webserver would accept them. This is done because web
servers do not usuallu provide a directory of all avarilable links and domains (unless
terrible configured), and so we would have to check for various links and see which
ones return pages. For example, if we visit https://www.hackthebox.eudoesnotexist, we 
would get a HTTP code 404 Page Not Found.
