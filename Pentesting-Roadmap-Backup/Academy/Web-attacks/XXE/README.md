#Advanced File Disclosure


Not all XXE vulnerabilites may be straightforward to exploit, as we have seen
in the previous section. Some file formats may not be readable through basic XXE,
while in other cases, the web application may not output any input values in some
instances, so we may try to force it throught errors.


#Advances Exfiltration with CDATA

In the previous section, we saw how we could use PHP filters to encode PHP source 
files, such tath they would not break the XML format when referenced, which(as we
saw) prevented us from reading these fiulels. But what about other types of web
Applications? We can utilize another method to eztract any kind of data (including 
binary data) for any web application backend. To output data that doesn't conform
to the XML format, we can wrap the content of the external file reference with a CDATA 
tag (e.g <![CDATA[ FILE_CONTENT ]]>). This way, the XML parser would consider this part
raw data, which may contain any type of data, including any special characters.

One easy way to tackle this issue would be to define a begin internal entity wih 
<![CDATA[, an end internal entity with ]]>, and then place our external entity file in 
between, and it should be consiedered as CDATA element. as followst:
