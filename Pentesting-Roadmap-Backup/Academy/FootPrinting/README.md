## Enumeration principles

Enumeration is a widely used term in cybver security. It stands for information
gathering using active (scans) and passive (use of third-party providers) methods.
It is ipmortant to note that OSINT is an independent procedure and should be per-
formed separately for enumeration because OSINT is based exclusively on passive
information gathering and does not involve active enumeration of the given target.
