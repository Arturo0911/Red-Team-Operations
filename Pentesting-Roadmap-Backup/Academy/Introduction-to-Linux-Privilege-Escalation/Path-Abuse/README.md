### Path Abuse

Path is an environment variable that specifies the set of directories where an
executable can be located. An account's PATH variale is a set of absolute paths,
allowins a user to type a command without specifying the absolute path to the binary.
For example, a user can type ```cat /tmp/test.txt``` intead of specifying the absolute
path ```/bin/cat /tmp/test.txt```. We can check the contents of the PATH variable by
typing env | grep PATH or echo $PATH

```
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo $PATH

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```


Creating an script or program in a directory specified in the PATH will make it executale
from any directory on the system.

```
htb_student@NIX02:~$ pwd && conncheck 

/usr/local/sbin
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1189/sshd       
tcp        0     88 10.129.2.12:22          10.10.14.3:43218        ESTABLISHED 1614/sshd: mrb3n [p
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      1189/sshd       
tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      1304/apache2    
```

As the show below, the ```conncheck``` script created in ```/usr/local/sbin``` will still run when in 
the ```/tmp``` directory it was created in a directory specified in the PATH


```
htb_student@NIX02:~$ pwd && conncheck 

/tmp
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1189/sshd       
tcp        0    268 10.129.2.12:22          10.10.14.3:43218        ESTABLISHED 1614/sshd: mrb3n [p
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      1189/sshd       
tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      1304/apache2
```

Adding . to user's PATH adds their current working directory to the list. For example,
if we can modify a user's path, we could replace a common binary such as ls with a ma
malicious script scuh as a reverse shell. If we add . to the path by issuing the command
```PATH=.:$PATH``` and then export PATH, we will be able to run binaries located in our
current working directory by just typing the name of the file (i.e. just tping ls will call
the malicious script named ls in the current workin directory instead of the binary located at /bin/ls)
