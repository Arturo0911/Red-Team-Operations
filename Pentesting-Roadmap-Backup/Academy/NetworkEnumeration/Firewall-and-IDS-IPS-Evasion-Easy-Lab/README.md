### Evasing the firewalls and the IPS/IDS


Basically, a lot of firewalls doesn't allow to show the port status. Some cases,
the port will be seen as filtered (by the firewall) you have to implement different
techniques to ge  the real status of the port and try to get further information
about the service already running on it.

The basic numeration:

```
nmap -p- --open <port>
```


The most commom way to bypass the firewall, it's using the parameter
```
--disable-arp-ping -Pn -n -sS 
```



in the hard lab, the first thing it's try to make and exhaustive scanning
checking which ports are open and filter
btw the common ports are open 

```
22 80
```

But here we can't get any information relevant, so trying to use even
the decoys  -D RND:<wherever number you want>

in root mode obviously

```
nmap -p- -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packe-trace --source-port 53 <host to scan>
```

Why --source-port parameter ? 
Well, using this condition, we can use the fucntion of the DNS resolver to get information about
the name of service already running on spcefic port, in this case the service of the hypotetically
company for the three labs, mention that, they have a service to allow handle big information of 
the customers, so in the previous example of the labs, mentioned the port 50000 so make the scanning
using that port:

```
nmap -sS -Pn -n -p 50000 --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace --source-port 53 <host or target>
```


and after that, make a simple connection with ncat:

```
ncat -nv --source-port 53 <host or target> 50000
```

and finally get the flag :)
