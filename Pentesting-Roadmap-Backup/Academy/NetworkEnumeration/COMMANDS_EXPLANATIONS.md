# Network enumeartion with NMAP


### Difference between UDP and TCP
  TCP is oriented to connection-protocol whereas UDP is connectionless protocol.
    TCP is more slower in comparasion with UDP, but only in TCP its possible to
    retransmission of lost data packets.


#### Discovering the top 10 protocols 
```
nmap <ip address> --top-ports=10
```

#### Discovering with the disable arp ping as parameter
```
nmap <ip address> -p <port>  --packet-trace -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping 
```

#### To know the reason that the port it's in that state, only include the --reason in your scanning
```
nmap <ip address> -sU -Pn -n --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping -p <port number>
```
