# Learning Process

This is the most important things (for me)
about how to take the information about this path
and how to use the most important things about it


This example, was very interesting for me
how you can interprete the path of the knowledge


```
Imagine you want to become a programmer, and you know that there are more
thatn 200 differente programming languages that can be used to create
applications that can be cracked by debugging or reverse engineering. If we
learned every programming language with 100 hours, we would spend 20,000 
hours or 2500 days (8 hours per day) or, in other words, almost severn years to
learn all of these programming languages. As a result, we spent seven years
learning all these languages and never tried to debuf or reverse engineer
the program we created. Great! Let us spend another severn years learning to debug
and reverser engineering.
```

So we have got the idea. No one wants to spend so much time on just on area.
Furthermore, thisis not necessary. We will need some time to learn different technical
principles, structures, and processes, but we will not need to spend seven years, Every
programming language has its own strengths and weaknesses. also, if we can obtain 
a deep undestanding of a simple programming language, we will learn others much 
faster. We do not need to learn every programming language to understand how to read
their code. All of them follow the same principles which R. D. Tennend initially defined:
