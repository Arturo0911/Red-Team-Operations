 Add to Basket
[Unknown INPUT type] Add to Basket
**** Description ****
This comic satire ridiculing northerners who opposed the Civil War was the
creation of Charles Godfrey Leland, late editor of the comic weekly Vanity Fair
and current editor of the definantly radical Continental Monthly. Though he
denied authorship during the war, he took full credit for it later. In a letter
he wrote near the end of his life, Leland asserted that he drew all of the
pictures, except No. 24, which was drawn by his brother. Furthermore he wrote
all of the verses, except four by Frank Wells, four by G.H. Boker, and three by
E.S. Rand. Leland had the nasty habit in his dotage to take credit for all
sorts of things he had little to do with, but in this case he is probably
reliable. A number of the full-page plates depict famous politicians of the
day, including Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Clement Vallandigham, Horatio Seymour,
and Fernando Wood. Oblong octavo.

he was captured and killed by the French in Dikoa and no longer in English Kuka
the new Sultan of Bornou resides, and on German soil lives the most powerful
adversary, the Rabeh found in the Lake Chad region, the prince of Mandara. For
us Germans in particular, it is therefore of particular interest to be
precisely informed about the events that took place in the Lake Chad region and
to know the history and development of these events, especially because we are
