# SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst



## What is a SOC?

A Security Operation Center (SOC) is the facility where the information security
team constantly monitors and analyzes the security of an organization. The main
purpose of the SOC team is to detect, analyze and respond to cyber security incidents
by using technoogy, people and proccesses.


## Types os SOC Models.
Depending on security requirements and budget, there are several types of
SOC.

### In-House SOC.

The enterprise build its own cybersecurity team. Firms considering
establishing aninternal SOC should have a budget to support continuity.


### Virtual SOC.
The security team does not have its own facility and often workds
remotely in different locations.


### Co-Managed SOC,
The Co-Managed SOC consists of internal SOC personnel working with 
an externel Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP). The coordination
is really important for this type of model.

### Command SOC.
A senior group that oversees smaller SOCs in a large region.
Organizations using this model include major telecom providers and
defense agencies.


### People. Process and Technology.
Building a successful SOC requires serious coordination. In particular,
there should be a strong relationship between people, processes, and 
technologies.

In simple terms, we will talk about which perople. processes and
technologies are required for SOC.


### People.

We need highly trained personnel familiar with security alers and
attack scenarios. As attack types are constantly changing, we need a 
teammate that can easily adapt to new attack types and is willing to 
research.



### Processes.

To bring your SOC structure to good maturity, you need to align it wih
many different types of security requirements such as NIST, PCI, HIPAA.
Processes require extreme standarization of actions to ensure nothing
is skipped.

### Technology.

You need to have various products for many topics such a penetration 
test, detection, prevention, analyze. You need to follow the marke and
technology closely to find the best solution for you. Sometimes the bes
product on the market may not be the best for you. This many be due to
you low budget.



## SOC Positions.

### SOC Analyst.

It can be divided into groups as Level 1, 2 and 3 according to the SOC
structure. A security analyst classifies the alert, looks for the cause,
and advises on remedial measures.


### Incident Responder.

The incident response officer is the person who will take part in threat 
detection. This person performs the initial assessment of security
breaches.


### Threat Hunter.

A team member whose purpose is to find vulnerabilities before the
attacker can exploit them with an attack.

### Security Engineer.
