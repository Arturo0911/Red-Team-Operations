Key WordPress Files

The root directory of WordPress contaihns files taht are needed to configure WordPress to function correctly.

-   index.php => is the homepage of WordPress.
-   license.txt => contains useful information such as the version WordPress installed.
-   wp-activate.php => is used for the email activation process whern setting up a new WordPress site.
-   wp-admin => folder contains the login page for administrator access and the backend dashboard. Once a user
                has logged in, they can make changes to the site based on their assigned permissions. The login page
                can be located at one of the following paths:

```bash
/wp-admin/login.php
/wp-admin/wp-login.php
/login.php
/wp-login.php
```


To list the methods available for the xmlrpc.php, we need to send the system.listMethods, and get the information in the wordpress server

curl -s -X POST -d "<methodCall><methodName>system.listMethods</methodName><params><param><value>admin</value></param><param><value>CORRECT-PASSWORD</value></param></params></methodCall>" http://83.136.255.235:33246/xmlrpc.php
