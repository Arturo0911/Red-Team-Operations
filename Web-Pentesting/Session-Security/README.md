# Session Fixation

Session  Fixation occurs when an attacker can fixate a (valid) session identifier. As you can imagine, the attacker will then have to 
trick the victim into loggin into the application using teh aforementioned session identifier. If the victim does so, the
attacker can proceed to Session Hijacking attack (since the session identifier is alreay known)
